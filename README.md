## Overview

This project implements a basic `DynamicArray` class in Java, offering an array that automatically resizes itself when it reaches capacity, making it useful for scenarios where the required storage capacity is unknown. This implementation includes methods for:
- Adding elements
- Removing elements
- Resizing as needed
- Basic array operations such as getting size and retrieving elements

## Features

- **Dynamic Resizing**: The array doubles in size automatically when needed.
- **Customizable Initial Capacity**: Set an initial size or use the default.
- **Efficient Element Insertion and Removal**: Manage elements with minimal overhead.
- **Size and Capacity Retrieval**: Know the current array size and maximum capacity.
